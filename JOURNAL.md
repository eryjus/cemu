This file is my journal for building this project.  I do not make modifications to the journal except to occasionally go back and clean up formatting concerns.  Even the typos will persist.  The first entry is on the top while the bottom entry is the more recent.

As you read the journal from top to bottom, you may see things revisited and decisions changed as the needs arise and as I learn more about what I am trying to accomplish.  Please enjoy!
